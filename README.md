# Build
To build, you will need the `zcc` compiler from the [z88dk kit](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk)

Just run `make` in the root of the project, after which the final binary file will appear.\
Then you can convert it to .tap file with [bin2tap](http://zeroteam.sk/bin2tap.html) utility

...you can also just look in the [releases](https://github.com/celtrecium/snek/releases) section of this repository and download the finished .tap file from there :-)
